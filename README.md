A web app to improve writing skills in any language.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this came from the lack of these kind of resources. You can find a ton of resources to master reading, listening or speaking a language. But when it comes to writing, there simply aren't much. 

## How it works
The app will function in these steps:
1. A user A will sign up with 2 languages, one in which they are proficient(say, English) and the other which they want to learn(say, Japanese).
2. Then they will write anything they need in, say, Japanese.
3. A user B, who is proficient in Japanese, will then verify and propose corrections.
4. Similarly if someone wants to learn English, user A can verify their messages.
5. Everyone is happy.

Initially the app will be based on twitter, that is, users will be editing tweets. Eventually, you will able to use this app without using Twitter at all!

## Waiting list
If you'd like to get an email when this website/app is ready, please sign up to our waitlist here: https://www.csdojo.io/wait

## Pre-requisites
We would need following installed in our system before we start with setting up the project in local machine.
1. Git - This is needed as a version control system. If you don't have this preinstalled in local machine, visit https://git-scm.com/downloads and setup git on local.
2. Python 3 - We are using Python as a programming language in this project. Mac and Ubuntu have it pre-installed. NOTE: you might have Python 2 on your Mac or Ubuntu. If so, make sure to download Python 3.

## Local Setup
1. Clone this repository into local system and change the directory.
   
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ykdojo/editdojoprivate.git
cd editdojoprivate/
```
2. Install pip3 and pipenv.

```sh
pip3 install pipenv
```
3. Go into the virtual environment: 
   
```sh
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
4. Apply migrations
   
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata languages.yaml
# NOTE: you can produce the same data in languages.yaml with
# python manage.py dumpdata users.Language --format=yaml > languages.yaml
```

5. Set up Twitter

For this, first, set up your environment variables.

You can take a look at .bash_profile_sample on how to set them up.

Then, run:

```
python manage.py shell < setup_twitter.py
```

On Heroku:

```
heroku run manage.py shell

exec(open("./setup_twitter.py").read())
```

6. Run the server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver <PORT>
OR
python manage.py runserver
```

7. Start the application opening the link shown in your terminal on a browser.


## Setup Redis-Queue and Background Tasks
1. Install Dependencies. Run ```pipenv update``` if pipfile.lock is out of date. 
2. Make sure your Heroku is set to Hobby Dynos.You can do this in the web console.
3. Add the redis addon in heroku ```heroku addons:create redistogo```
4. start up an rqworker ```python manage.py rqworker in_twitter_queue``` (in this case, our queue is named in_twitter_queue)
5. start up worker monitoring ```python manage.py rqstats```
6. run ```heroku run python job_scheduler.py --help``` to schedule / add jobs to the queue. The command line argument is currently WIP.
